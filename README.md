# Random-Forest-Algorithm
Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm - Random Forest Algorithm
In this the predicted outputs from different decision trees are joined in such a way to make the final prediction.To build the algorithm I used python programming language The main libraries used for making of the algorithm were from sklearn, imblearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib. The function ‘time’ was used to calculate the processing time of training and testing functions of the algorithm.

The dataset goes through a number of such formulas to predict final output. Each application has been given a unique label and belongs to a specific class. Each label has a particular set of features on the basis of which the model will be trained and tested. The next job was to train and evaluate the data set following labelling. Training(60%) and testing(40%) are divided in this case, for instance:—
 X train & X test = used in the class for features.  
 Y train & Y test = used as labels of applications corresponding to features of X

Four types of evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model. A confusion matrix was also drawn to determine the number of True positives, True negatives, False positives and False negatives.
